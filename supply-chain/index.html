        <p>Since our founding in 1968, Fetzer Vineyards has been committed to providing the highest quality wines to our customers. We know this mission begins with the relationships we have with suppliers around the world, and we truly value our long-lasting partnerships.</p>
        <p>Recently, the State of California passed the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act with the purpose of ensuring that companies like ours disclose their efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from their supply chains. The vast majority of Fetzer Vineyards’ suppliers are located in the United States and must comply with Federal employment laws. The remaining suppliers are located in EU countries with stringent employment laws and practices. While Fetzer Vineyards does not conduct audits of its suppliers to evaluate compliance with our standards and values, nor have we required suppliers to provide certification that they comply with laws regarding human trafficking and slavery, we remain committed to ethical business practices and will not knowingly conduct business with suppliers who do not comply with the fair, ethical and legal treatment of workers.</p>
        <h2>What we believe</h2>
        <h4>Business Partners &amp; Supplier Relations</h4>
        <p class="margin">We seek business partnerships that align with our Core Values and follow the highest standards of business conduct. We conduct due diligence on new suppliers and agents acting on our behalf and help suppliers understand our ethics and compliance standards and their contractual obligations. We train our employees who have direct responsibility for supply chain management in the laws and issues regarding human trafficking and slavery, and require them to report to Management any supplier or business partner that may not be meeting our standards.</p>
        <h4>Social Responsibility</h4>
        <p class="margin">While we have not yet engaged in the verification of product supply chains to evaluate the risks of human trafficking and slavery, we support and respect efforts to protect human rights and advance social and environmental sustainability. We ensure that employees work of their own free will. We do not accept corporal punishment, forced labor, involuntary labor or other forms of mental and physical coercion. We do not use or permit the use of child labor.</p>
        <h4>Fairness &amp; Equal Opportunity</h4>
        <p class="margin">We believe that everyone should be treated with fairness, respect and dignity. As an equal employment opportunity employer, we comply with all laws and regulations concerning nondiscriminatory employment practices. We base employment decisions on qualifications, demonstrated skills and achievements, irrespective of age, race, gender, nationality, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, physical ability, thinking style, veteran’s status, or any other characteristic protected by applicable laws. We set the expectation with our key stakeholders that we believe they should act in a way that is consistent with our sense of fair treatment and equal opportunity.</p>
